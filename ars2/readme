exp_1 with tournament selection
exp_2 with roullete wheel selection

exp_3 with roullete wheel with tougher fitness function for collisions


exp_4 changed how mutation is being done - instead of generating -1,1 new numbers, 
we change the existing ones by a percentage


exp_5 we changed the sensor values that are inputed to the controller!


exp_6 we normalized the fitness values based on the average of entire population


exp_7 we normalized fitness by each map and also by average of total_avg map
